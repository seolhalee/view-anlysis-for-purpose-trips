# Augmenting the Visaul Experience on GPS Tracks using Machine-Learning Techniques

  - RQ1. How can we infer the purpose of daily trip of people from their GPS location data? 
  - RQ2. Is there any common pattern of trips that people in Tokyo take throughout a day? 
  - RQ3. How different are the visual experience of the trips with different purposes?

I designed this study into two separate steps with two machine learning techniques respectively. 
- First, I developed a prediction model of trip purpose using Xboosting framework using the extensive Person Trip (PT) survey data and predict the purpose of trips in the GPS data. 
- Second, I adopted a computer vision technology called scene parsing, which segment and classify images in pixel-level with semantic categories of objects using Convolutional Neural Network.
